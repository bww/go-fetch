# Go Fetch

Go Fetch can be used to copy dependencies recursively into a project, it is intended to be used with the "Go 1.5 Vendor Experiment" `vendor` package.

Go Fetch is not a dependency manager. Unlike the [many](https://github.com/tools/godep), [many](https://github.com/niemeyer/gopkg), [many](https://github.com/gpmgo/gopm), [many](https://github.com/mattn/gom), [many](https://github.com/nitrous-io/goop) Go dependency managers out there, Go Fetch does not attempt to manage anything for you. It assumes that you will update dependencies manually by running `gofetch` and manage the set of dependencies you require externally â€“ in a makefile, for example.

## What it does

Go Fetch will download packages with similar semantics to `go get` (from which it borrows a fair amount of source):

1. Given a package (e.g., `github.com/gorilla/websocket`) Go Fetch will download the package source to the directory you indicate,
2. It will parse all the Go source files in that package and inspect the packages imported by those files,
3. For every import that has a prefix which looks "domain-y" (e.g., `github.com/...`, `bitbucket.com/...`, etc) it will recursively fetch that package as well, and so on.

Go Fetch strips VCS information when it downloads packages and therefore packages cannot be updated by pulling (or the equivalent for non-git VCS). This is done so that it's straightforward to commit the source to vendored packages into your own repository.

In order to "update" a package it must be re-fetched in its entirety and this must be done explicitly. Presumably the updated repo (and it's dependencies, which are also updated as part of the process) would be committed into your repo.
